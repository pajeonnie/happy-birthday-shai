      <p>honestly, we met in the most unlikely of places as well as the most unsual time xD
        we first met at around 4am in my friend's room waiting for boxes of pizza to arrive and honestly
        i'm quite glad im an insomniac otherwise i wouldn't have been awake that night and met you!
        it was strange at first, seeing a random guy in my friend's bed but i remember looking at you
        and my first initial thought being "hey he's kinda cute" hehehe xD i told my friend of course but
        she never did relay the message so our first kind of hangout or date took like a month and a bit HAHAHA
        granted i was in a time and space where i didn't feel like i was ready to be in a relationship then and
        to be honest i still feel that way now but you saying to give us a try is something i don't and will never
        regret. even after everything i am super grateful for where we are now and how far we've come both in our
        friendship and relaionship. we may haven't been together for that long but i'm still grateful for us and
        having someone like you to lean on. every relationships are gonna have their ups and downs of course
        however i find those to be opportunities where we learn to support one another through the difficult times
        and after every obstacle we faced and the more we do face, will show just how much we've grown together.
        do you know what i love most about our relationship? it's the little things. the calls, the text messages, 
        every little reaction we give to eachother when the other has something to show. we are in a distanced
        relationship but these little things helps so much and i am forever grateful <3</p>
