      <p>well first things first, you were of course born on the 10th of
        december which is today! but that's not what this page is about...
        i am here to tell you who you are as a person... who you are to me.
        you are someone who is smart, sweet and honestly quite stubborn minded
        xD im kidding!!! maybe... but you know who you are not even to just me
        but to everyone! you are someone that i can rely on for any problems i 
        may face in life and you help me overcome them. you are someone who helps
        bring comfort to those around you. even just being around you i know that
        everyone else can agree with the fact that you make us feel safe. you are 
        truly an amazing person and you may not think it but you are. just look at
        everyone around you! you are someone worth loving, you are someone who is 
        worth the time and effort both for friendships and in a relationship. so
        don't ever think you're not good enough in any aspects because to me you
        perfect the way you are <3</p>
